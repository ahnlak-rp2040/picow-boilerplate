# PicoW C++ Boilerplate Project

This is a template repository, inspired by and based on Pimoroni's 
[Pico C++ Boilerplate Project](https://github.com/pimoroni/pico-boilerplate). 
It is specifically designed to help leverage the additional features of the
PicoW, but obviously parts of it that do not require the WiFi / Bluetooth
functionality will be transferable to a regular Pico.

These pages attempt to document everything you'll need to know to get developing;
it does *not* attempt to teach you C++; there are way better books available to
do that.

The primary assumption is also that you're working on a Linux box, or Raspian,
or at least WSL under Windows. Although in theory it's possible to build 
'natively' under Windows, I no longer really have a Windows desktop to test it
on.


## The Overall Process

* [Setting Up Your Environment](setting-up-env.md) explains what you need to have
  installed and configured to be able to build projects based on this template.
* [Creating Your Project](creating-projects.md) walks you through setting up a
  new repository based on this template, and preparing to build.
* [Building Your Project](building-projects.md) explains how to actually run
  the build process, and gives your your `uf2` file.
